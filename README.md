# david johnson application

This is my application for Holiday Extras.

The task I have chosen to undertake is the Flickr API

You can view it here: http://davidjohnsonjsplayground.space

I have built the single page application using Backbone.js

I have commented the code to explain how I have built and structured the application.

# Extra features I have added are:

1. A favourite icon 'star' to each photo.  This turns gold if you 'favourite' it.

2. Search functionality based on off the title of the photo.

3. A responsive 'tiled' layout, that changes positions of the photos as you resize.

4. Infinite scroll functionality, which loads a new 20 photos when you scroll to the bottom of the feed.

5.  A click through from the smaller photo to a larger photo view - (this could have lots of extra info in it, if the JSON feed had a more usable description property.)
